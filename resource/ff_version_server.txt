SERVER version:
- only the first line of this file matters
- this determines the version of the SERVER
- it can only be up to 15 characters long

// Okay the server and client are versioned separately so that we can do a 
// client- or server- only update if required.
// The client version is checked when FF is loaded
// The client + server versions are checked when a server is joined
// It is the discretion of the web-based version check script whether or not
// to tell the client to upgrade or that the server they are joining is out of date.
